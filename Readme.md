# 🛡️ CyberShield  
**AI-powered detection and blocking of hidden web trackers**

CyberShield is a privacy-first Chrome extension that detects **hidden trackers and surveillance cookies**, explains **who is tracking you and why**, and lets users **block or allow trackers in real time**.

Unlike traditional blockers, CyberShield focuses on **clarity and control** — not just blocking, but *explaining*.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Modern websites silently track users using:
- Third-party scripts
- Tracking pixels
- Persistent surveillance cookies

Most users:
- Don’t know **who** is tracking them
- Don’t know **why** they are being tracked
- Have no clear way to **control** it

Existing tools block trackers blindly, often breaking websites and confusing users.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

CyberShield makes invisible tracking **visible and understandable**.

It:
- Detects hidden third-party trackers on websites
- Analyzes tracker behavior using clear signals
- Uses AI to explain tracker intent in simple language
- Allows users to **Block, Allow once, or Always allow**
- Provides a dashboard to manage blocked trackers and view analytics

Not just blocking. **Explaining and empowering.**

## 🔍 Key Feature

**Tracker Explainability**

> “Detects hidden trackers and explains how they silently monitor user behavior.”

This builds trust and helps users make informed decisions.

---

## 🔄 How It Works

1. User opens a website  
2. Browser extension scans scripts, images, and cookies  
3. Tracking behavior is converted into signals  
4. Signals are sent to the backend API  
5. Backend classifies the tracker (rule-based)  
6. AI generates a human-readable explanation  
7. User chooses to block or allow the tracker  
8. Browser enforces blocking at the network level

## 🧩 Extension Architecture

- **Content Script**
  - Detects external scripts and tracking pixels
- **Background Script**
  - Observes cookies and network behavior
  - Communicates with backend
  - Applies blocking rules
- **Popup UI**
  - Displays tracker details and actions
- **Dashboard Page**
  - Manage blocked trackers
  - View basic analytics

## 🧠 Signals (Behavior Evidence)

Signals are privacy-safe indicators generated by the extension:

- `third-party`
- `persistent-cookie`
- `cross-site`
- `pixel`
- `analytics`
- `unknown-domain`

They describe *what a tracker does*, not who the user is.
